# Geometric-Design-System
Built a geometric design system using object-oriented principles, focusing on shape intersections and robust test- ing with JUnit to identify edge cases and ensure accuracy. Incorporated exception handling and design patterns like Composite, Iterator, and Singleton to enable hierarchical compositions and efficient instance management.

The entire design system is divided into 3 parts.
