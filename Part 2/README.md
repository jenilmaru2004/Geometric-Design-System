Part 2: Testing and Exception Handling
This part builds on the system from Part 1 by introducing comprehensive testing and exception handling. Using JUnit, test cases are designed to verify the accuracy of shape intersection methods under various conditions. Additionally, exception handling is incorporated to manage invalid shape creation, such as circles with a non-positive radius or line segments with coinciding endpoints. A custom exception class, ShapeArgumentException, is implemented to handle these cases gracefully. This phase ensures the robustness and reliability of the system while maintaining clean code practices.
