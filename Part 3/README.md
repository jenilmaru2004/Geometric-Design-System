Part 3: Advanced Features with Design Patterns

The final part extends the system by integrating three design patterns:

- Composite Pattern: Introduces a CompShape class to allow grouping of primitive shapes and other composite shapes, enabling complex geometric compositions.

- Iterator Pattern: Implements an Iterator for CompShape to access individual components in a structured way.

- Singleton Pattern: Adds a Drawing class to ensure a single instance manages the overall drawing composition.
  
These patterns enhance the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the system, making it suitable for more complex applications and workflows.
